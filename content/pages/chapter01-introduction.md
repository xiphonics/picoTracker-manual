# Welcome

Welcome to picoTracker, a small, portable music making device based on the tracker workflow.

But what is a "tracker"?

Trackers are music production applications that started life on 16bit home computers such as the legendary Amiga 500. 
Trackers later evolved to also run on devices such as the Gameboy as popularised by LSDJ and this then inspired the LittleGPTracker (LGPT) which was designed to run on portable Linux-based gaming handheld devices. LGPT then served as the starting point for the firmware for the picoTracker, though it has now substantially diverged from those roots, being customised for the specific hardware of the picoTracker and gaining many new features and improvements.

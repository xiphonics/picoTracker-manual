## Navigation

The picoTracker user interface is made up of a series of screens, which are layed out in a "map" which is represented at the bottom right of each screen with a single letter representing each screen, along with highlighting with a different color which screen is currently being displayed on screen. For example below you can see the screen map with the Song screen (S) shown as being currently displayed.

On bootup, the picoTracker will start on the Song screen of the last previously opened project.

The picoTrackers keypad layout resembles a typical old console game controller.

You can navigate (aka move) between screens using the `[]` + `arrow` keys.

To get to the chain screen, you need to have your cursor on a chain in the song. To get to the phrase screen, you need to have your cursor on a pattern in the chain screen.

## Playback Modes and Controls

There are two modes for playback, Song and Live. The controls in each mode differ slightly.
You can switch between the modes by hitting B+LEFT/RIGHT in the Song screen.

## Shutdown
You can just unplug the machine any time you want other than when saving a project (which is an extremely brief moment). Save your work first if you care about it.

Welcome to picoTracker, a small mobile music making device based on the tracker workflow.

But what is a "tracker"?

Trackers are music production applications that started life on 16bit home computers such as the legendary Amiga 500. 

## Navigation

The picoTracker user interface is made up of a series of screens, which are layed out in a "map" which is represented at the bottom right of each screen with a single letter representing each screen, along with highlighting with a different color which screen is currently being displayed on screen. For example below you can see the screen map with the Song screen (S) shown as being currently displayed.

You can navigate (aka move) between screens using the `[]` + `arrow` keys.
